TidyData Code Book

Final TidyData set contains 180 rows and 88 columns.
All the values are means, aggregated over 30 subjects [1..30] and 6 activities ["walking","walking_upstairs","walking_downstairs","sitting","standing","laying"]

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequency domain signals. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are mean and standard deviation.
